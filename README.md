# Gazebo Sim tests

Gazebo Sim test suite deliberately inspired from [Allison Thackston's](https://www.althack.dev/ignition_vs_gazebo/), i.e. I stole most of the code from her.

It comes with a vscode-compatible devcontainer environment to set up test dependencies. To run tests, simply execute the `start_test.sh` script in every directory.
